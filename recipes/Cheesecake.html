            <ul id="ingredient list">
                  <li>1 (4 ounce) bar chocolate, chopped</li>
                  <li>Â½ cup cream cheese, softened</li>

            <h3>Directions</h3>
            <ol>
                  <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).<br>
                        Line the bottom of a 9-inch springform pan with parchment paper.</li>
                  <li>Place white chocolate in top of a double boiler over simmering water.<br>
                        Stir frequently, scraping down the sides with a rubber spatula to avoid scorching, until
                        chocolate is melted, about 5 minutes.<br>
                        Remove and allow to cool slightly.<br>
                        Mix in cream cheese and egg yolks.</li>
                  <li>Beat egg whites in a large glass, metal, or ceramic bowl with an electric mixer until stiff peaks
                        form.<br>
                        Fold in the cooled white chocolate mixture.
                        <br>Pour into the prepared springform pan and bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes.<br>
                        Reduce oven temperature to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C) and bake for an additional 15
                        minutes.<br>
                        Turn the oven off, leaving cheesecake inside for for a further 15 minutes.<br>
                        Remove cheesecake from the oven and allow to cool completely at room temperature, about 1
                        hour.<br>
                        Chill before serving, about 3 hours.
                  </li>
            </ol>
